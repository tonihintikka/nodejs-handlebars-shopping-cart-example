I was doing Academind Tutorial and I've got this part done [NodeJS / Express / MongoDB - Build a Shopping Cart - #6 Sign Up View, CSRF Protection & User Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waAqEjjssxU) This is very interesting tutorial and I have got new things to me. CSRF session protection was one thing that I heard first time during todays session.

I have found that when we talk about 5 years old tutorial, it's quite long time. In this example there was things with Handlebars that doesn't work todays standards. I cannot put Mongoose object directly to handlebars. I need to use [lean()](https://github.com/tonihintikka/nodejs-handlebars-shopping-cart-example/blob/0adf74063be3d34e6b43c38310b5d59016494bb1/routes/index.js#L10) - method to get JSON instead.
